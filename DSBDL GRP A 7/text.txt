Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables machines to understand and interpret human language. It bridges the gap between computers and humans by analyzing, tokenizing, and processing textual data. Techniques like stemming and lemmatization play a crucial role in simplifying text data while retaining its meaning. NLP is widely used in applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and search engines.
